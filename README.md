# IBM IoT for Automotive - Fleet Management Starter Application

The IBM IoT for Automotive - Fleet Management Starter Application demonstrates how quickly you can build an app on IBM Bluemix to manage and monitor a fleet of vehicles in real time.

## Overview

The Fleet Management Starter Application uses services in IBM Bluemix to provide a sample solution for fleet operation management and personnel. By using the application, you can easily track and view the following information:

- Availability of a fleet of cars on a map
- Location of vehicles
- Overall health of the entire fleet
- Health diagnostics and conditions of a specific vehicle in the fleet
- Condition of vehicles by order of severity or risk
- Event history for the entire fleet
- Event history for a specific vehicle in the fleet

The Fleet Management Starter Application uses the following services that are available on IBM Bluemix:

- [IoT for Automotive (Experimental)](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/iot-for-automotive/)
- [Cloudant NoSQL DB](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/cloudant-nosql-db/)

## Deploying the app on Bluemix

You can automatically deploy an instance of the Fleet Management Starter Application on Bluemix by clicking [![Deploy to Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/fukudasjp/iota-starter-server-fm.git). You can also deploy the app manually. 

To manually deploy your own instance of the Fleet Management Starter Application on Bluemix, complete all of the following steps:

1. [Register][bluemix_signup_url] an account on Bluemix or use an existing valid account.
2. Download and install the [Cloud-foundry CLI][cloud_foundry_url] tool. 
3. Clone the Fleet Management Starter Application to your local environment by using the following console command:  

   ```  
   git clone https://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/iota-starter-server-fm.git  
   ```  
   
4. Change to the directory that you created. 
5. Edit the `manifest.yml` file and change the values of `<name>` and `<host>` to something unique.

  ```
  applications:
         :
    host: iota-starter-server-fleetmanagement
    name: iota-starter-server-fleetmanagement
    memory: 512M
    path: .
    instances: 1
         :
   ```
   The host value is used to generate your application URL, which is in the following syntax:  
   `<host>.mybluemix.net`.
   
6. Install the NPM package by using the following command. The installer observes the dependencies that are specified in your `package.json` file.
   ```
  $ cd ./webclient
  $ npm install 
   ```
7. Convert TypeScript to JavaScript: 

   ```
   $ npm run tsc
   $ npm run gulp
   $ cd ..
   ```
   
8. By using the command line tool, connect to Bluemix and log in when prompted:

  ```
  $ cf api https://api.ng.bluemix.net
  $ cf login
  ```
  
9. Create an instance of the IBM IoT for Automotive service in Bluemix:

  ```
  $ cf create-service iotforautomotive free_shared FleetIoTForAuto
  ```
  
10. Create an instance of the Cloudant NoSQL DB service in Bluemix:

  ```
  $ cf create-service cloudantNoSQLDB Lite FleetCloudantDB
  ```
  
11. Push the starter app to Bluemix by using the following command. Because you will need to perform more steps when the app is deployed, you must add the option `--no-start` when you run the `push` command.

  ```
  $ cf push --no-start
  ```
Your very own instance of the IBM IoT for Automotive - Fleet Management Starter Application is now deployed on Bluemix.

## Activating the Bluemix services

Before you can use the IBM IoT for Automotive - Fleet Management Starter Application, you need to do the following tasks:

- [Activate the **IBM IoT for Automotive** service](#activate)
- [Configure authentication](#authent)

### <a name="activate"></a> Activating the IBM IoT for Automotive service

1. If the app is already running on Bluemix, stop the app.

2. Open the [Bluemix dashboard][bluemix_dashboard_url] in your browser.

3. Open the IBM IoT for Automotive service and then wait for a few seconds until the user credentials display.

### <a name="authent"></a> Configuring authentication

To secure the app, authentication is enabled by default for the IoT for Automotive - Fleet Management Starter Application. The default user credentials are as follows:

User name | Password
----- | -----
starter | Starter4Iot

- To change the user name or password that is used by the app, edit the values that are specified for the `APP_USER` and `APP_PASSWORD` environment variables.

- To remove authentication, set both the `APP_USER` and `APP_PASSWORD` environment variables to 'none'.

## <a name="run"></a> Starting the app

- To start the Fleet Management Starter Application, open the [Bluemix dashboard][bluemix_dashboard_url] and start the app.

Congratulations! You are now ready to use your own instance of the IBM IoT for Automotive - Fleet Management Starter Application. Open `http://<host>.mybluemix.net` in your browser.

## Reporting defects
To report a defect with the IoT for Automotive - Mobility Starter Application mobile app, go to the [Issues section](https://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/iota-starter-server-fm/issues) section.

## Troubleshooting
To debug problems, check the Bluemix app logs. To view the logs, run the following command from the Cloud Foundry CLI:

  ```
  $ cf logs <application-name> --recent
  ```
For more information about how to troubleshoot your application, see the [Troubleshooting section](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/troubleshoot/tr.html) in the Bluemix documentation.

## Privacy Notice

The IoT for Automotive - Fleet Management Starter Application includes code to track deployments to [IBM Bluemix](https://www.bluemix.net/) and other Cloud Foundry platforms.

For each instance that you deploy, the following information is sent to a [Deployment Tracker](https://github.com/cloudant-labs/deployment-tracker) service:

* Application name (`application_name`)
* Space ID (`space_id`)
* Application version (`application_version`)
* Application URIs (`application_uris`)
* Labels of bound services
* Number of instances for each bound service

The tracked data is collected from the `VCAP_APPLICATION` and `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variables in IBM Bluemix and other Cloud Foundry platforms. We use the data to track metrics around deployments of sample applications to IBM Bluemix to measure the usefulness of our examples so that we can continuously improve the content that we offer to you. Only deployments of sample applications that include code to ping the Deployment Tracker service are tracked.

### Disabling deployment tracking

You can disable the Deployment Tracker service by removing `require("cf-deployment-tracker-client").track();` from the beginning of the `app.js` server file.
